## Grading policy and key dates
- Grading:
    - Quiz: 4 times (20%)
    - Program assignment: 2 times (20%)
    - Midterm: 1 time (30%) (Nov 15, 2020)
    - Final: 1 time (30%) (Jan 15, 2021)
- Assignments:
    - **10% per day** penalty for late submission
        - 1 day late: 90.0 score point
        - 2 day late: 81.0 score point
        - 3 day late: 72.9 score point
        - And so on...
    - All Program assignment submissions will be subject to duplication checking
        - Don't copy classmates' homework
        - It is useless to change the variable or add spaces
- Exams: 
    - In-class
    - Open-note
        - The puzzle is like an open book, the answer is right in front of you but you can't find anything
    - Question in English!!!
